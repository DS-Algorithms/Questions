# Center(s) of an undirected tree
 
 
#### Question
An interesting problem when you have an undirected tree is finding the tree’s center node(s). 
This could come in handy if we wanted to select a good node to root our tree

Note: The center is always the middle vertex or middle two vertices in every longest path along the tree.

# 137. Single Number II
 
leetcode url: https://leetcode.com/problems/single-number-ii/
 
#### Question
Given an integer array nums where every element appears three times except for one, which appears exactly once. Find the single element and return it.

You must implement a solution with a linear runtime complexity and use only constant extra space.
# Example 1:

```
Input: nums = [2,2,3,2]
Output: 3
 ```
 
 # Example 2:

```
Input: nums = [0,1,0,1,0,1,99]
Output: 99
```


# Constraints:

```
* 1 <= nums.length <= 3 * 104
* -231 <= nums[i] <= 231 - 1
* Each element in nums appears exactly three times except for one element which appears once.
 ```
